			<p>
				The Rogue is sneaky and capable of getting into areas others can't. She can't take a hit like the warrior,
				nevertheless she is a skilled fighter with a precise strike capable of doing serious damage. Use her to get at
				enemies behind obstacles or to back up the warrior.

				<h4>Special Abilities</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Leap</li>
					<p>
						This ability allows the rogue to leap over a single obstacle tile so long as it doesn't exceed two tiles distance. It has a cost of 3 action points. The rogue cannot
						move after using this ability but can attack if she has the ability points.
					</p>
					<li>Precision Strike</li>
					<p>
						This ability gives the rogue an increased chance for a critical strike (critical strike will do regular damage * X where X is a random number between 1 and 6)
						on their turn. The rogue cannot attack the same turn the ability is used. The rogue can move before, but not after using this ability. Precision strike costs 3
						action points.
