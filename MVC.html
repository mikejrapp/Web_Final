			<p>One dark and stormy evening on a full moon, you sit down for your regular game of Gaols and Goblins. At first
				Nothing seems out of the ordinary. However, you begin to notice that the surroundings you are so familar with
				have somehow taken new form. Instead of your friends moldy, asbestos ridden basement you are sitting in a dank,
				rotting gaol (or jail for a more modern spelling). The smell of mildew and wood rot, among other things, tinges 
				the air. You look around confusedly and see that your friends, decked in medieval garb, are just as bewildered as
				you. Seemingly in your mind, a deep voices echoes. "Welcome, mortals, to the moldy basement." Suddenly the pieces
				on your dungeon map begin to grow and take on the grotesque forms of the monsters you sought to do combat with in
				your silly role playing game.</p>
